# Completed. 
1. recover your Token contract and added mint function to mint token to simpleDistributor contract. 
2. recover simpleDistributor contract from your contract address. 
3. test build with typescript. from token deploy to claim, can test step by step. 
4. call original contract form your token address and contract address in Rinkeby. and implement test with typescript. 
5. deploy script is build. 

# Assum. 
1. assum share of user is same(from your backend)
2. you have to increase nonce manually to test original contract for last claim contract. 

# Merkle tree prove. 
You used merkle tree, user's is in list of share list. so decrease search deep and algorithm complexibity. 
implemented on-chain verification with smart contract and local verification with merkletreejs.
